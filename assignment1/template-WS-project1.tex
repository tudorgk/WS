% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% For tracking purposes - this is V2.0 - May 2012

\section{Introduction}
Write the introduction to the project here, in your own words. Note that the study of Lawrence and Giles is outdated; today, several studies have been published on estimating the size of the indexable Web. Give an overview of \textbf{\textit{at least two}} studies in this area that have been published from 2000 onwards. You can find these studies by searching Google Scholar or the ACM digital library (\url{http://dl.acm.org}). 

\section{Methodology}
Describe the methodology of this study in your own words. You can use the same notation as \cite{LawLee1998} for the formulas, but the descriptions must be in your own words.

\section{Findings}
Report your findings in tables and figures (equivalent to Tables 1-2 and Figures 1-3 in \cite{LawLee1998}). You must also discuss these tables and figures.


\section{Conclusions}
Describe your conclusions.

% The following two commands are all you need in the

% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{citations}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
